      <p className="text-block">
        Emerging from the depths of London and South East England,{' '}
        <strong>The Giant</strong> is a doom metal project forged in sorrow,
        atmosphere, and weight. Founded by Edward Yerburgh and Andrew Kang, the
        band draws deeply from the legacy of genre defining acts such as
        Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, Opeth, Katatonia, and Swallow the
        Sun—blending bleakness and beauty into a sound that is both crushing and
        contemplative.
      </p>

      <p className="text-block">
        Formed with a clear vision to explore the emotional extremities of doom,{' '}
        <strong>The Giant</strong> released their debut EP <em>Seasons</em> in
        2024. The record introduced listeners to a sonic landscape where despair
        and melody intertwine, offering a meditative yet relentless experience.
      </p>

      <p className="text-block">
        Their forthcoming EP, due for release at the end of 2025, promises to
        expand upon the foundations laid by <em>Seasons</em>—delving further
        into themes of loss, transformation, and the passage of time.
      </p>

      <p className="text-block">
        This is music for the long shadow, the grey horizon, and the quiet
        collapse of light.
